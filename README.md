# Competitive Programming
These are my attempts to become a better programmer.

It mainly includes solutions for problems in **LeetCode, HackerRank and UVA platforms**. Most of them are **sorted considering their difficulty and topic**. Sometimes (rarely) the topic won't match the topic in the platform because the topic in this repository is related to the main approach that I took to solve the problem. The difficulty always matches the difficulty in the platform.

Currently this repository includes **solutions for 80+ problems**. Unfortunaly lots of problems that I solved in UVA and some in LeetCode a while ago aren't included in this repository. That would raise the amount of solutions to about 120+ solutions.
