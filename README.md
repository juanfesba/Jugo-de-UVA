# Competitive Programming
These are my attempts to become a better programmer.

It mainly includes solutions for problems in LeetCode, HackerRank and UVA platforms. Most of them are sorted considering their difficulty and topic. Sometimes (rarely) the topic won't match the topic in the platform because the topic in this repository is related to the main approach that I took to solve the problem.
